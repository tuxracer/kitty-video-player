/**
 * kitty-player library entry. Re-exports the public surface for hosts that
 * embed the Player in their own Ink app instead of running the CLI. The cli
 * module is deliberately not exported (it is the executable bin entry and
 * runs the player on import).
 *
 * Exports are explicit rather than star exports because several modules
 * define their own MS_PER_SECOND. Star-exporting them all would make that
 * name ambiguous and silently drop it, so per-module duplicates like
 * MS_PER_SECOND stay internal.
