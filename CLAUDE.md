# kitty-player

## Commands

- `pnpm check` - typecheck + lint + run all tests (run before committing)
- `pnpm test` - vitest in watch mode (`pnpm test:run` for a single pass)
- `pnpm lint` / `pnpm lint:fix` - ESLint over `src/`
- `pnpm typecheck` - `tsc --noEmit`
- `pnpm build` - typecheck then tsup. The build has two entries: `cli` (the executable bin, `dist/cli.js`, which runs the player at module top level) and `index` (the library entry, `dist/index.js`, for hosts embedding the Player in their own Ink app). They must stay separate bundles because importing the cli entry starts playback
- `pnpm dev` - run the CLI from source via tsx. `pnpm dev --help` forwards flags as expected, but `pnpm dev -- --help` does not (pnpm 11 passes the literal `--` through as a positional, which the CLI rejects as an unsupported file argument)

## Architecture

Data flow: `cli` parses argv (`parseCliArgs`, a pure function in its own file so tests can import it without executing the entry) and guards on terminal capability. If stdout is not a TTY it prints a notice and exits 0 (CI-friendly). If `detectFallbackReasons` reports missing placeholder support or a tmux/screen session, it warns and offers half-block mode (`--half-block` skips the prompt and also forces the mode on supported terminals). The fallback path never renders Ink: `runFallbackPlayer` drives a probe-free half-block Screen with its own clock and raw-stdin keys. Otherwise it opens the `FrameSource` (`ffmpegSource` when a file argument is given, the built-in `proceduralSource` otherwise), computes the panel `region` with `computePanelRegion`, and awaits kitty-motion's `createScreen` BEFORE calling Ink's `render()`. That ordering is load-bearing because the capability probes read responses from stdin, and Ink's `useInput` takes stdin over once rendering starts. Then it renders `<Video screen source info autoPlay loop controls keyboard title help />` with `exitOnCtrlC: false` so Video's own input handler can dispose the Screen and close the source before Ink tears down.

`Video` owns the playback clock, in the `usePlaybackClock` hook. A `setInterval` at the source frame rate lives outside React state, refs mirror `playing` and elapsed time as the source of truth for the interval callback, and an in-flight guard keeps async `getFrameAt` calls from piling up behind a slow source. Frames go straight to `screen.pushFrame()`, bypassing React entirely, and React state (so an Ink redraw) updates only when the displayed whole second changes. On terminal resize Video debounces the stdout `resize` event, calls `screen.setRegion()` with a freshly computed panel region, RE-READS `screen.getPlaceholderRows()` (the grid size can change, so the old rows are stale), and repaints the current frame.

`FrameSource` is the seam the ffmpeg decoder plugs into. It is a pull model: the player's clock requests frames by timestamp via `getFrameAt(timeMs)`, `null` means no frame is ready and the player keeps showing the last one, and returned buffers may be reused by the source (valid only until the next call). `seek(timeMs)` makes nearby reads cheap, `close()` is idempotent.

### Module map

- `src/cli/` - executable bin entry (`index.tsx` runs the player on import) plus `parseCliArgs.ts`, the exit codes, help text, and `VERSION`
- `src/Video/` - the Ink component `Video` (with `Player` kept as a backwards-compatible alias): playback clock in `usePlaybackClock.ts`, self-managed resource lifecycle in `useManagedResources.ts`, probe-free Screen construction in `managedScreen.ts`, plus the two-mode props union (external resources vs. self-managed)
- `src/frameSource/` - interface-only module holding the `FrameSource`/`FrameSourceInfo` contract (no implementation, no consts)
- `src/fallbackPlayer/` - half-block fallback playback for unsupported terminals: probe-free `createFallbackScreen` (full-screen, autoResize) plus `runFallbackPlayer`, a React-free port of the playback clock with raw-stdin keys (space, arrows, q/Ctrl-C) and no Ink UI
- `src/proceduralSource/` - the built-in demo source, a hue-cycling ball on a Lissajous path rendered as a pure function of time into a reused framebuffer
- `src/ffmpegSource/` - decodes video files with bundled ffmpeg-static/ffprobe-static: ffprobe metadata probe, one streaming ffmpeg process decoding rawvideo rgb24 into a readahead queue (stream pause/resume backpressure), respawned with input-side `-ss` on seek or backward time jump, frames scaled to fit 960x540
- `src/playerLayout/` - `computePanelRegion` sizes the video panel's cell grid from the terminal size via kitty-motion's `fitToTerminal`, and `computeEmbeddedRegion` letterboxes a source frame into a fixed cell box for embedded mode (deliberately not via `fitToTerminal`, whose minimum-display floor distorts small boxes)
- `src/formatTime/` - millisecond timestamps as `m:ss`, switching to `h:mm:ss` at one hour
- `src/index.ts` - library entry with explicit (not star) re-exports, because several modules define their own `MS_PER_SECOND` and star exports would silently drop the ambiguous name

## Gotchas

- **`createScreen` before Ink `render()`**: the kitty-motion capability probes read stdin, and Ink's `useInput` takes stdin after `render()`. Creating the Screen after rendering hangs or corrupts the probe handshake. The cli entry already does this in the right order, keep it that way
- **Re-read placeholder rows after `setRegion()`**: the placeholder grid size can change with the region, so cached rows go stale. The Player's resize effect calls `screen.getPlaceholderRows()` again after every `setRegion()`
- **`minimumReleaseAge` install policy**: `pnpm-workspace.yaml` blocks package versions published less than 7 days ago, with `kitty-motion` excluded (our own package, every published version is newer than the cutoff). If `pnpm add` or `pnpm update` fails to resolve a brand-new release, pin an older version instead of fighting the resolver
- **AGENTS.md is a symlink to CLAUDE.md**: edit CLAUDE.md only, never create a separate AGENTS.md
- **ink is pinned to 5.x with react 18**: `@inkjs/ui` 2.x targets ink 5, and Ink's width measurement of the placeholder cells is version-sensitive. ink 7 requires react 19 and is a deliberate future upgrade, not a casual dependency bump
- **`VERSION` in `src/cli/consts.ts` mirrors package.json**: it is a literal (importing package.json from outside `src/` breaks the tsconfig include), so bump it together with the `version` field on every release
- **ffmpeg-static needs its install script**: `pnpm-workspace.yaml` allowlists `ffmpeg-static` under `allowBuilds` because it downloads its binary in a postinstall step. If the CLI dies with ENOENT spawning ffmpeg, the script was blocked. Run `pnpm install --force` after checking the allowlist

## Git

- **Never create merge commits**: When integrating a branch, always rebase. Use `git rebase`, `git pull --rebase`, or `git merge --ff-only` to keep history linear. Never run a plain `git merge` that produces a merge commit.

## Coding Standards

- **Package manager**: Use `pnpm` for all package management (install, add, remove, etc.)
- **ESM imports only**: Always use `import` syntax, never `require()`. This is an ESM project and `require` will throw `ReferenceError: require is not defined`
- **Explicit `.ts`/`.tsx` extensions on relative imports**: Write `from "./consts.ts"` and `from "../Player/index.tsx"`, never extensionless `from "./consts"`. Enforced by ESLint
- **Erasable syntax only**: `erasableSyntaxOnly` is on in tsconfig. No constructor parameter properties (`constructor(private foo: T)`), enums, or namespaces. Declare fields explicitly and assign in the constructor
- **Arrow functions**: Use `const foo = () => { ... }` (enforced by ESLint, auto-fixable with `pnpm lint:fix`)
- **Reserve `use` prefix for React hooks**: This project has real React hooks (Ink components), so the `useFoo` naming convention is reserved for them. For boolean options or flags, use names like `systemFont`, `enableCache`, or `withValidation` instead of `useSystemFont`, `useCache`, or `useValidation`
- **Named constants**: Use `const HEADER_SIZE = 16` not magic numbers
- **Numeric separators**: Use underscore separators for numbers 1000 and above for readability (`1_500`, `44_100`, `100_000`)
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: When a pattern appears 3+ times, extract it into a helper function. This improves readability and maintainability without impacting performance
- **Module structure**: Always create modules as directories with `index.ts` (or `index.tsx` for components), never as single `moduleName.ts` files. Name the directory after the primary export (class, function, component, or concept). This provides a consistent location for related files:

  ```
  # GOOD - directory structure allows for growth
  src/
    Player/
      index.tsx      # exports the Player component
      tests.tsx      # tests for the module (.tsx when tests render JSX)
      consts.ts      # SEEK_STEP_MS, HELP_TEXT, etc.
      types.ts       # PlayerProps, PlayerScreen interfaces
    formatTime/
      index.ts       # exports formatTime()
      tests.ts
      consts.ts

  # BAD - single files have nowhere for related code to go
  src/
    Player.tsx
    formatTime.ts
  ```

  Standard files within a module directory:
  - `index.ts` / `index.tsx` - Main module implementation and exports (no constants or type definitions here)
  - `tests.ts` / `tests.tsx` - Tests for the module (`.tsx` when the tests render components)
  - `consts.ts` - **All** module-specific constants (primitives, arrays, objects)
  - `types.ts` - **All** type definitions, interfaces, and type guards

- **Keep index.ts focused on implementation**: The `index.ts` file should only contain the main implementation (classes, functions, components). All constants go in `consts.ts` and all types/interfaces/type guards go in `types.ts`:

  ```typescript
  // BAD - constants defined in index.ts
  // Player/index.tsx
  const SEEK_STEP_MS = 5_000;
  export const Player = () => { ... };

  // GOOD - constants in consts.ts, imported into index.tsx
  // Player/consts.ts
  export const SEEK_STEP_MS = 5_000;

  // Player/index.tsx
  import { SEEK_STEP_MS } from "./consts.ts";
  export const Player = () => { ... };
  ```

- **Re-export types and consts from index.ts**: Each module's `index.ts` should re-export all types and consts from `types.ts` and `consts.ts`. External code should import from the module, not directly from internal files:

  ```typescript
  // GOOD - import from the module's index
  import { SEEK_STEP_MS, PlayerProps } from "../Player/index.tsx";

  // BAD - importing directly from internal module files
  import { SEEK_STEP_MS } from "../Player/consts.ts";
  import type { PlayerProps } from "../Player/types.ts";
  ```

  One exception is deliberate here. `src/index.ts` uses explicit named re-exports instead of `export *`, because several modules define their own `MS_PER_SECOND` and star exports would silently drop the ambiguous name

- **JSDoc**: Skip `@param`/`@returns` tags (TypeScript provides types), use inline comments if needed
- **Doc comments on interface/type properties**: Use a `/** ... */` block comment above the property, not a trailing `//` comment. Editors surface `/** */` on hover, but trailing `//` comments are invisible until you scroll to that line:

  ```typescript
  // GOOD - shows on hover in editors
  export interface ProceduralSourceOptions {
    /** Source framebuffer width in pixels (default 240) */
    width?: number;
  }

  // BAD - trailing comment doesn't show on hover
  export interface ProceduralSourceOptions {
    width?: number; // Source framebuffer width in pixels (default 240)
  }
  ```

- **Export interfaces**: Almost always export `interface`/`type` declarations, even ones that look internal to a module. Consumers (and tests) frequently need to reference a function's options or return shape, and an unexported type forces them to redefine or `ReturnType<>`/`Parameters<>` it instead:

  ```typescript
  // BAD - unexported, so callers can't name this type
  interface PanelRegionOptions {
    termCols: number;
    termRows: number;
    sourceWidth: number;
    sourceHeight: number;
  }

  // GOOD - exported so callers can use the type directly
  export interface PanelRegionOptions {
    termCols: number;
    termRows: number;
    sourceWidth: number;
    sourceHeight: number;
  }
  ```

- **Loading indicators**: Delay by ~1 second to avoid flash for fast operations
- **Intl API**: Prefer `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, `Intl.NumberFormat`, etc. over manual formatting for dates, numbers, and currencies
- **Explicit conditionals for derived values**: When a value is derived from another value, use the source value in conditionals, not the derived value. This makes the logic clearer and avoids confusion:

  ```typescript
  // GOOD - explicit about what each branch handles
  if (this.limitColors === 16) {
    /* ANSI 16 */
  } else if (this.limitColors === 256) {
    /* ANSI 256 */
  } else {
    /* True color (limitColors === 0) */
  }

  // BAD - confusing because useTrueColor is derived from limitColors
  if (this.limitColors === 16) {
    /* ANSI 16 */
  } else if (this.useTrueColor) {
    /* True color */
  } else {
    /* ANSI 256 */
  }
  ```

- **Type guards over type assertions**: Never use `as` type assertions on values with unknown runtime types. Write small hand-rolled type guards instead:

  ```typescript
  // GOOD - type guard validates at runtime
  const isString = (value: unknown): value is string => typeof value === "string";

  if (isString(value)) {
    config.name = value;
  }

  // BAD - blind cast assumes type without validation
  config.name = value as string;
  ```

  For union types (e.g., `ColorSpace` from kitty-motion), create a type guard that validates the actual values, not just the primitive type:

  ```typescript
  // GOOD - validates the value is one of the allowed options
  if (isColorSpace(value)) {
    config.colorSpace = value; // No cast needed
  }

  // BAD - isString only checks primitive type, not valid union values
  if (isString(value)) {
    config.colorSpace = value as ColorSpace; // Still a blind cast!
  }
  ```

  When creating type guards for union types, use the named type in the return type annotation - don't hardcode the union:

  ```typescript
  // GOOD - uses the named type
  import type { ColorSpace } from "kitty-motion";

  const COLOR_SPACES: readonly ColorSpace[] = ["rgb15", "rgb24"];

  export const isColorSpace = (value: unknown): value is ColorSpace =>
    isString(value) && COLOR_SPACES.includes(value as ColorSpace);

  // BAD - hardcodes the union type (duplicates the type definition)
  export const isColorSpace = (value: unknown): value is "rgb15" | "rgb24" => {
    // ...
  };
  ```

- **Typed errors over string messages**: When throwing errors, create a custom error class with a typed `code` property instead of using plain `Error` with string messages. This enables type-safe error handling:

  ```typescript
  // GOOD - typed error with machine-readable code
  type MyErrorCode = "NOT_FOUND" | "PERMISSION_DENIED" | "TIMEOUT";

  class MyError extends Error {
    readonly code: MyErrorCode;
    constructor(code: MyErrorCode) {
      super(code);
      this.name = "MyError";
      this.code = code;
    }
  }

  const isMyError = (error: unknown): error is MyError => {
    return error instanceof MyError;
  };

  // Usage - callers get autocomplete and type checking
  try {
    await doSomething();
  } catch (error) {
    if (isMyError(error)) {
      switch (error.code) {
        case "NOT_FOUND": // TypeScript knows valid codes
        // ...
      }
    }
  }

  // BAD - string messages aren't type-safe
  throw new Error("Not found");
  throw new Error("Permission denied");
  ```

- **Tests verify behavior, not implementation**: Tests should verify that code works correctly, not enshrine implementation details. Never write tests that just check constant values - if a constant matters, test the behavior it affects:

  ```typescript
  // BAD - tests implementation detail, provides no value
  it("should have expected default value", () => {
    expect(SEEK_STEP_MS).toBe(5_000);
  });

  // GOOD - tests actual behavior that depends on the constant
  it("should seek 5 seconds forward on right arrow", () => {
    stdin.write("[C");
    expect(fakeSource.lastSeekMs).toBe(5_000);
  });
  ```

## Documentation Style

Applies to all prose: README, doc comments, JSDoc, commit messages, and PR descriptions.

- **No emdashes**: Never use emdashes (—) or spaced hyphens as emdash substitutes. Restructure into separate sentences, or use a comma, colon, or parentheses instead:

  ```
  # BAD
  The player is light — roughly one Ink redraw per second — so the UI never stutters.

  # GOOD
  The player is light (roughly one Ink redraw per second), so the UI never stutters.
  ```

- **No semicolons or mid-sentence colons**: Human-written docs rarely use them, AI-generated ones lean on them constantly. Split into separate sentences instead. A colon that introduces a list, example, or code block is fine:

  ```
  # BAD
  Ink owns the layout; the pixels are kitty-motion's problem: encoding, diffing, and backpressure.

  # GOOD
  Ink owns the layout. The pixels are kitty-motion's problem, covering
  encoding, diffing, and backpressure.
  ```

- **No AI-isms**: Avoid filler words and hype phrasing that reads as machine-generated. Say what the thing does in plain, direct language:
  - Banned words: "delve", "leverage" (as a verb; use "use"), "seamless", "seamlessly", "robust", "powerful", "cutting-edge", "blazingly fast", "supercharge", "elevate", "streamline", "harness" (as a verb), "unlock", "empower", "crucial", "comprehensive", "furthermore", "moreover", "additionally" (as a sentence opener)
  - Banned constructions: "It's not just X, it's Y", "Whether you're X or Y", "In today's world of...", "Let's dive in", "the beauty of X is", rhetorical questions as section openers
  - No summary padding: skip closing paragraphs like "In conclusion" or "With these tools in place, you're ready to..."

  ```
  # BAD
  kitty-player provides a robust, seamless playback experience that empowers
  you to effortlessly watch video in the terminal. Whether you're demoing or
  debugging, it's not just smooth, it's blazingly fast.

  # GOOD
  kitty-player plays video in the terminal through an Ink UI. Frames bypass
  React entirely, so Ink redraws about once per second while pixels update
  at 30fps.
  ```

- **Concrete over promotional**: Prefer measurable claims ("Ink redraws once per second") over adjectives ("high-performance"). If a claim has no number or specific behavior behind it, cut it.
