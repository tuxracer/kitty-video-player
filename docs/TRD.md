# kitty-video-player technical reference

How kitty-video-player works internally. For installation, controls, and CLI flags,
see the [README](../README.md).

## Overview

kitty-video-player has two rendering paths. The full player is an
[Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) app whose video pixels are drawn by
[kitty-motion](https://github.com/tuxracer/kitty-motion) through Kitty graphics
Unicode placeholders. The placeholder cells are ordinary text that Ink lays
out, so the picture and the React-driven UI share the terminal without
stepping on each other. The fallback player skips Ink entirely and drives a
kitty-motion Screen directly, for terminals that cannot host the full player.

## Startup sequence

The CLI entry (`src/cli/index.tsx`) runs the player at module top level.
Argument parsing lives in `parseCliArgs`, a pure function in its own file so
tests can import it without executing the entry.

1. Parse argv. Unsupported flags and extra positionals exit with an error.
2. Guard on terminal capability. If stdout is not a TTY, print a notice and
   exit 0 (CI-friendly, nothing is drawn).
3. Resolve the render path (see below).
4. Open the `FrameSource`. No argument opens the built-in
   `proceduralSource`. A file or http(s) URL argument is classified first,
   with a single `probeMediaFile` ffprobe run (the local existence check is
   skipped for URLs, ffprobe itself reports an unreachable one), and
   `openMediaSource` branches on the result: `ffmpegSource` for a real video
   stream, `coverArtSource` for an audio-only file with embedded cover art
   (falling back to `waveformSource` if the art fails to decode), and
   `waveformSource` for audio without art. The same classification answers
   the audio player's has-audio probe, so the file is only ffprobed once. An
   open still running after `LOADING_DELAY_MS` shows a loading indicator on
   stderr (an animated spinner line on a TTY, erased again when the open
   finishes, or one plain notice elsewhere), since a remote probe can take
   seconds with nothing else on screen yet. It runs before any Ink render
   exists, so `startLoadingIndicator` writes the same dots animation
   @inkjs/ui's Spinner uses directly to stderr.
5. Run the full player or the fallback player.

### Render path resolution

Forced modes resolve immediately, with no probe and no prompt:

- `--render-mode kitty` alone forces the full Ink player past detection.
- `--fallback` alone, a cell `--render-mode` (half-block, cell-background,
  emoji, ascii), or `--fallback --render-mode kitty` all force the fallback
  player. The last combination is a forced kitty-without-controls tier for
  terminals like iTerm2 that have graphics but no placeholders. It is also the
  escape hatch for tmux with allow-passthrough configured.

With no flags, `detectFallbackReasons` checks for missing placeholder support
and tmux/screen sessions. If it reports a reason, the CLI resolves the
fallback tier first via `resolveFallbackRenderMode`, then warns and prompts
with wording that matches the resolved tier. Declining exits 0.

`resolveFallbackRenderMode` picks the tier in this order:

1. A forced mode wins untouched.
2. A multiplexed session (tmux or GNU screen) skips the graphics probe and
   takes the auto cell mode. The multiplexer swallows the graphics escapes
   even when the environment looks like kitty, so the kitty tier is never
   auto-selected there.
3. Otherwise the kitty graphics probe decides. A pass selects kitty graphics
   without controls, a fail falls through to `detectCellRenderMode`
   (cell-background on Terminal.app, half-block elsewhere).

## The full player

### Screen creation must precede Ink render

The CLI computes the panel region with `computePanelRegion` and awaits
kitty-motion's `createScreen` BEFORE calling Ink's `render()`. This ordering
is load-bearing. The kitty-motion capability probes read responses from
stdin, and Ink's `useInput` takes stdin over once rendering starts. Creating
the Screen after rendering hangs or corrupts the probe handshake.

The CLI then renders
`<Video screen source info autoPlay loop controls keyboard title help />` with
`exitOnCtrlC: false`, so Video's own input handler can dispose the Screen and
close the source before Ink tears down.

### Embedding with external resources

The same external-resources mode is available to hosts embedding `Video` in
their own Ink app. Most embedders should use the self-managed
`<Video src>` / `<Video srcObject>` mode from the README instead, which
constructs a probe-free Screen after Ink owns stdin and never hits the
ordering constraint. External resources are for hosts that need a fully
probed custom Screen or a non-Ink renderer, and they inherit the CLI's
obligation to create the Screen before `render()`:

```tsx
import { render } from 'ink';
import { createScreen } from 'kitty-motion';
import { computePanelRegion, createProceduralSource, Video } from 'kitty-video-player';

const source = createProceduralSource();
const info = await source.open();

const region = computePanelRegion({
  termCols: process.stdout.columns,
  termRows: process.stdout.rows,
  sourceWidth: info.width,
  sourceHeight: info.height,
});

// Create the Screen before rendering Ink. createScreen probes the terminal
// through stdin, and Ink's useInput takes stdin after render().
const screen = await createScreen({
  output: process.stdout,
  sourceWidth: info.width,
  sourceHeight: info.height,
  colorSpace: info.colorSpace,
  placement: 'unicode',
  embedded: true,
  region,
  autoResize: false,
  autoDispose: false,
});

render(
  <Video screen={screen} source={source} info={info} autoPlay loop controls keyboard title help />,
  { exitOnCtrlC: false },
);
```

The host owns the lifecycle of everything it passes in, including an optional
already-opened `audio` player.

### Placeholder rendering

`Screen.getPlaceholderRows()` returns one string per grid row, and Video
renders each as an ordinary Ink `<Text>`. The terminal fills those cells with
the video, so the picture participates in Ink layout like any other text.

### Playback clock

`Video` owns the playback clock, in the `usePlaybackClock` hook:

- A `setInterval` at the source frame rate lives outside React state. Refs
  mirror `playing` and elapsed time as the source of truth for the interval
  callback. The playhead itself advances against a wall-clock anchor reset
  at every gate release, not by counting ticks: a late timer fire
  permanently loses its lateness (one to two percent under decode load),
  and a tick-counted clock drags behind the wall-paced audio device until
  the drift snap fires periodically forever.
- An in-flight guard keeps async `getFrameAt` calls from piling up behind a
  slow source.
- Frames go straight to `screen.pushFrame()`, bypassing React entirely, so
  pixels update at the source frame rate without any Ink redraw.
- React state (and therefore an Ink redraw) updates only when the displayed
  whole second changes. Ink redraws roughly once per second, for the time
  readout and progress bar.
- A two-phase buffering gate holds the clock at startup, after seeks, loop
  wraps, replays, resumes, and drift resyncs, and the interval retries the
  gated position each tick instead of advancing. Phase one waits for the
  source to deliver the frame at the playhead. Phase two starts audio there
  and keeps holding until the source's readahead is comfortably full
  (`FrameSource.isBuffering`, about a second of decoded frames) and the
  audio has made sound or reported it cannot (`AudioPlayer.isStarting`,
  which stays true while the audio player holds back its
  `AUDIO_PREBUFFER_MS` lead). Playback therefore begins with buffered
  cushions on both streams, with picture, bar, and sound together. Remote
  URLs take seconds to produce their first frame and their first sound,
  and without the gate the bar runs ahead while the skipped content is
  never shown. A hold outlasting `LOADING_DELAY_MS` shows an @inkjs/ui
  spinner with a buffering label in the controls row (`clock.buffering`
  drives it), so a slow start looks like loading instead of a hang. Once playback is underway a null frame still advances the
  clock, so frames drop and playback stays realtime. Seeks and wraps move
  the playhead synchronously (the bar tracks the jump immediately,
  HTML5-style) and bump a timeline counter so a frame fetch from the old
  position cannot write its timestamp over the new one.

The clock also drives an optional `AudioPlayer`. Every audio start
(startup, seek, wrap, replay, resume) goes through the buffering gate, so
`playFrom` always targets exactly the held playhead and the two streams
release together. The video clock stays master. Once per displayed second
it compares the audio player's reported position against its own elapsed
time, and a drift beyond `DRIFT_RESYNC_THRESHOLD_MS` (250 ms) re-arms the
gate, which restarts audio at the playhead and holds until it is audible
again. A null position means the player has nothing audible to report (not
playing, drained, or a fresh decoder that has produced no sound yet) and
the clock leaves it alone. That last case matters for remote streams: a
decoder can take seconds to deliver its first sample, and snapping during
that window would kill and respawn it every second, forever, playing
nothing. A dead decode attempt (crash, or a seek past the end of the audio
track) stops counting as starting, so it releases the gate instead of
stalling it. Audio problems never interrupt playback. A missing audio
track, a missing output device, or a decoder crash all degrade to silent
video instead of an error.

### Resize handling

On terminal resize Video debounces the stdout `resize` event
(`RESIZE_DEBOUNCE_MS`, 150 ms), calls `screen.setRegion()` with a freshly
computed panel region, re-reads `screen.getPlaceholderRows()`, and repaints
the current frame. The re-read matters because the placeholder grid size can
change with the region, so cached rows go stale.

## The fallback player

`src/fallbackPlayer/` handles terminals that cannot run the full Ink player.
`createFallbackScreen` builds a probe-free Screen at the resolved render mode
(full-screen, autoResize), and `runFallbackPlayer` is a React-free port of
the playback clock with raw-stdin keys (space, arrows, m mute, q/Ctrl-C) and
no Ink UI. It never renders Ink.

## The FrameSource contract

`src/frameSource/` holds the `FrameSource`/`FrameSourceInfo` contract as an
interface-only module (no implementation, no consts). It is a pull model. The
player's clock requests frames by timestamp:

- `open()` returns the stream info (pixel dimensions, color space, duration,
  frame rate).
- `getFrameAt(timeMs)` resolves the frame at or nearest after that timestamp.
  `null` means no frame is ready and the player keeps showing the last one.
  Returned buffers may be reused by the source, so they are valid only until
  the next call.
- `seek(timeMs)` repositions the source so nearby reads are cheap (a no-op
  for random-access sources).
- `close()` releases decoder resources and is idempotent.

## Built-in sources

### proceduralSource

The demo source, a hue-cycling ball on a Lissajous path over a 20 second
loop, rendered as a pure function of time into a reused framebuffer. It plays
when the CLI is run with no file argument.

### mediaProbe

Classifies a file or http(s) URL with one ffprobe run, feeding both the
source construction and the audio player:

- A real video stream (one whose disposition is not `attached_pic`) makes
  the file `kind: 'video'`, carrying native dimensions, frame rate, duration,
  and whether an audio stream is also present.
- Otherwise an audio stream makes it `kind: 'audio'`, carrying duration and
  the embedded cover art's native dimensions when the container has an
  attached picture.
- A file with neither video nor audio streams rejects with a
  `MediaProbeError` of code `NO_PLAYABLE_STREAMS` (also `FILE_NOT_FOUND` for
  a missing local path and `PROBE_FAILED` for unreadable media or missing
  metadata).
- When the container header carries no duration (live-muxed files),
  `probeMediaFile` falls back to demuxing the relevant stream to null at
  stream-copy speed and reading the last progress timestamp, the same
  recovery `ffmpegSource` already used for video.

`ffmpegSource` accepts this probe pre-computed (`FfmpegSourceOptions.probe`),
so the CLI never probes a file twice.

### coverArtSource

Shows an audio file's embedded cover art as a static image. A one-shot
ffmpeg run decodes the picture once at `open()`. `getFrameAt` always returns
the decoded frame regardless of the requested timestamp (the playback
clock's buffering gate retries at the playhead on startup, seeks, resumes,
and drift resyncs, and would stall against a source that goes quiet),
pushed at a nominal 10 fps so repeated identical frames stay cheap. An
undecodable picture rejects `open()`, and `openMediaSource` falls back to
`waveformSource`.

### waveformSource

Renders a live oscilloscope of an audio file's waveform. One ffmpeg process
decodes the whole track to mono 8 kHz s16le PCM in a single pass into a
preallocated buffer (about 57 MB per hour of audio), so seeks are free
window moves rather than a decoder respawn. `getFrameAt` draws the min/max
sample span of each pixel column across a window centered on the playhead.
`isBuffering` holds the playback clock's gate until the decode is 2 seconds
ahead of the playhead, and a decoder crash freezes the trace instead of
failing playback.

### ffmpegSource

Decodes video files with bundled ffmpeg-static and ffprobe-static, so no
system install is needed:

- ffprobe runs a metadata probe up front (dimensions, duration, frame rate,
  display-matrix rotation).
- One streaming ffmpeg process decodes rawvideo rgb24 into a readahead queue,
  capped at 60 frames (about one second of video), with stream pause/resume
  backpressure.
- A seek or backward time jump respawns ffmpeg with `-ss`. Its placement
  depends on whether ffmpeg can seek the input, detected once at open with a
  one-byte Range request (`detectRangeSupport`): input-side for local files
  and range-supporting servers (jumps straight to the target), output-side
  for non-seekable streams (reads from the start and discards decoded
  output up to the target). A start at zero passes no `-ss` at all, because
  even `-ss 0` makes the matroska demuxer attempt a seek that corrupts
  VP9 decoding on a non-seekable live-muxed stream. The audio decoder
  follows the same rules.
- Frames are scaled to fit 960x540 at decode time. kitty-motion scales the
  framebuffer to the panel region anyway, so decoding beyond that cap is
  wasted memory and CPU (a 4K rgb24 frame is about 24 MB, a capped one about
  1.5 MB).

## Layout

`src/playerLayout/` sizes the video panel:

- `computePanelRegion` sizes the panel's cell grid from the terminal size via
  kitty-motion's `fitToTerminal`.
- `computeEmbeddedRegion` letterboxes a source frame into a fixed cell box for
  embedded mode. It deliberately does not use `fitToTerminal`, whose
  minimum-display floor distorts small boxes.

## Module map

- `src/cli/` - executable bin entry (`index.tsx` runs the player on import)
  plus `parseCliArgs.ts`, `detectFallbackReasons.ts`, `confirmFallback.ts`,
  the exit codes, help text, and `VERSION`
- `src/Video/` - the Ink component `Video`, the playback clock in
  `usePlaybackClock.ts`,
  self-managed resource lifecycle in `useManagedResources.ts`, probe-free
  Screen construction in `managedScreen.ts`, and the two-mode props union
  (external resources vs. self-managed)
- `src/frameSource/` - the `FrameSource`/`FrameSourceInfo` contract
- `src/audioPlayer/` - the `AudioPlayer`/`AudioPlayerInfo` contract
- `src/ffmpegAudioPlayer/` - the file audio decoder, one ffmpeg process per
  `playFrom` decoding into an audify (RtAudio) output device
- `src/fallbackPlayer/` - `resolveFallbackRenderMode`, `createFallbackScreen`,
  and `runFallbackPlayer`
- `src/proceduralSource/` - the built-in demo source
- `src/mediaProbe/` - `probeMediaFile`, `MediaProbeError`
- `src/coverArtSource/` - the embedded cover art source
- `src/waveformSource/` - the waveform oscilloscope source
- `src/ffmpegSource/` - the file decoder
- `src/playerLayout/` - `computePanelRegion` and `computeEmbeddedRegion`
- `src/formatTime/` - millisecond timestamps as `m:ss`, switching to
  `h:mm:ss` at one hour
- `src/index.ts` - library entry with explicit (not star) re-exports, because
  several modules define their own `MS_PER_SECOND` and star exports would
  silently drop the ambiguous name

## Build layout

The build (tsup) has two entries that must stay separate bundles:

- `cli` (`dist/cli.js`) is the executable bin. It runs the player at module
  top level, so importing it starts playback.
- `index` (`dist/index.js`) is the library entry, for hosts embedding the
  `Video` component in their own Ink app.
